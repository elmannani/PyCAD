A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Features

- Draw cylinders, circles, and spheres directly within CATIA.
- Specify parameters including radius, height, and coordinates for precise shape creation.
- Seamless integration with CATIA through the pycatia library.
- User-friendly interface for intuitive shape generation.
- Enhances productivity by automating the creation of geometric shapes in CATIA.
- Ideal for CAD enthusiasts, engineers, and designers seeking to streamline their modeling workflow.


## Requirements:
- pycatia library.
- CATIA software installed on the system.
- Python 3.x.
- google GEMINI
## Installation
